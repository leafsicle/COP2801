variables: length, width, area, costPerSqFoot, and totalCost
1. Start by getting the values for length and width. 
2. Once you multiply those values together you will have the value for area.
3. Multiply that value by the costPerSqFoot variable to get the totalCost.
4. Print out the area and the totalCost.
