variables will be: lbsOfRecycling, lbsPerDay, and programLength

1. To start off we need to get user input for the pounds of recycling that are required to meet the overall goal.
2. Once the lbsOfRecycling variable has been set we can see determine how long the program should run for as programLength.
3. Once we have these two variables set we can divide the lbsOfRecycling by the programLength to get the total of lbsPerDay.
